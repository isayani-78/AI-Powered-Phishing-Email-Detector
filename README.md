## 👩‍💻 About
The **AI-Powered Phishing Email Detector** is a cybersecurity project that **automatically detects phishing emails** using **AI and Machine Learning**.  

It analyzes **email headers, content, and URLs** to identify phishing attempts, helping individuals and organizations **prevent cyber attacks**.  
This project is part of my research in **Digital Forensics & Ethical Hacking**.

## ✨ Features
- Detects phishing emails using **content, header, and URL analysis**  
- **Machine learning / AI classification** for high accuracy  
- Provides **phishing risk scores and alerts**  
- Batch analysis support for multiple emails  
- Easy-to-integrate module for email security workflows

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – core programming  
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch** – AI & ML models  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – data handling  
- **NLP** – content analysis  
- **Regex & URL parsing** – header & link analysis  
- **JSON / CSV** – datasets  
- **Tkinter** (optional) – GUI for user interface

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Load email data (headers, body, URLs)  
2. Preprocess and clean the data  
3. Extract features for analysis  
4. Run AI/ML model to classify emails  
5. Output **phishing score** and **alert** for suspicious emails
